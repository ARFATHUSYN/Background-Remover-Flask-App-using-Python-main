# Background-Remover-Flask-App-using-Python-main

This Flask project utilizes the OpenCV library to remove the background from images uploaded by users. The web application provides a user-friendly interface for removing backgrounds from images. he provided Python Flask project does not explicitly involve any machine learning or deep learning models. Instead, it focuses on image processing using libraries like OpenCV (cv2), rembg for background removal, and Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation. These libraries are primarily used for traditional computer vision tasks and image processing, rather than employing machine learning models.
